The BDN would like to consider itself a digital first, or the even more
aspirational digital only, publishing company. In 2012, they made
strides to adopt a digital first workflow, and the innovations there
still lead many publishers. I know this because after decrying the
flagrant defiance of best practices in our code base, I personally heard
many journalists at the Online News Association (ONA) annual conference
in 2016 talk about the system they heard of, which intergrated google
docs, WordPress, and InDesign. Conceptually, it is beautifully simple.
