# Tell me about a time when you encouraged the adoption of a new tool
to a set of users?

When I arrived at the BDN, there were a few things that stood out to me
as ready for change. To put this in context, working at the BDN would be
my third full time position since graduating with my Computer Science
degree. The bulk of my professional life to this point remains the
financial industry of Manhattan. Our conservative company culture still
allowed for fairly rapid adoption of certain technologies. Particularly
in the form of communication. Fidessa was right there with the rest of
the corporate world at the height of the blackberry corporate phone
market dominance, just prior to the release of the iPhone (iOS) &
Android platforms.

Before we had internal instant messenging in the form of some microsoft product whose name I forget, we used yahoo
messenger almost exclusively and unofficially. Once the internal instant messaging app landed, we could have
discussions in regular groups or channels with dozens of participants. Of course this was years before slack.

Then I went to work at Parse.ly, with a fully distributed product team spread across the United States, Canada, and
occassionally Scotland. I was employee number 15, and it was an excellent place to land after spending 8 years with
Fidessa. I picked up a lot of new tools that I had been admiring from afar for a while.

This company actually worked full time in Python. Unfortunately for me, I had been primarily fascinated with node.js
at the time, and this really annoyed the rest of the engineering team. But, before I left I did release my first
Django application code into production. That little bit of code produced a internal monitoring page showing the API
usage level per endpoint, per client.  Diving into Django to build that application caused me to fall in love with it
. I've written three additional django projects since that time.

Parse.ly really excelled at establishing productive communication patterns, and coordinating a remote team. They were
 very results oriented, and seemed to effectively support the growth and productivity of their colleagues.

My job at the BDN was a move back to an office culture. There were a lot of similarities to Fidessa in the dress code
 and communication style, yet the BDN had a distributed workforce across the state of Maine and was actively adopting
  web development technologies.

When I arrived at the BDN they had not yet adopted a group messaging platform. Thankfully, the organization was using
Google apps, and so gmail and hangouts chat was ubiquitous. A few weeks after I joined I was able to introduce slack.
 This was October 2014, and slack had only recently hit the scene. While I was at Parse.ly we used Flowdock, which
 was earlier to market than slack, but must look like a weak competitor to slack at this point in 2017.


But even though Fidessa pays me well, gives me career advancement opportunities, and shows great flexibility toward
my wishes to work from New Jersey and later as one of the first remote employees from Maine, I needed to move on. It
was nice when we got to take a break from writing closed source proprietary tools in TCL and got to write closed
source proprietary tools in Java. But I began to feel like I was missing on on the rapid innovation occuring in the
open source world and in web development in particular.

I guess that I was tired of never being able to show any of my work to anyone. I also did not like the prospects of
working in such an antiquated niche language, TCL. There were attempts by a few rogue developers to introduce python,
 even just for supporting scripts and utilities, but this effort was met with solid resistance. Once, I even produced
  a report describing the benefits I thought Fidessa could realize by developing a REST HTTP/JSON API. But the report
   I delivered went to a manager who didn't have an incentive to consider my suggestion, and didn't have the
    authority to develop something like that which would have been such a departure from what we were doing at the time.
