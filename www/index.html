    <h2>Work</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>Civic Hacking - Code for America brigade Co-Captain of <a href="http://code4maine.org/">Code 4 Maine</a></li>
     <li>Connecting Makers - President and co-founder <a href="http://hacktivate.org/">Hacktivate</a></li>
   </ul>

    <h2>Hire Me</h2>
    <p>I'm taking consulting clients and would love to work with you. Here are a few of the technologies I'm working with at the moment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Python and the Django web framework.</li>
      <li>PHP and wordpress.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm excited about the current project I'm working on which will bring a new level of specificity to reporting and discourse on our nation's legislative process.</p>
    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>My typical tools of choice include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>javascript - node.js server side or in the browser.</li>
        <li>python - flask, django, etc.
        <li>git - for version control</li>
        <li>Postgres, MySQL, or Mongo at the database layer.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Open source wherever possible.</p>
    <h2>Remotely Working</h2>
    <p>I rely heavily on google hangouts, docs, and other apps for collaborating both in real-time and asynchronously with my colleagues and clients.
    I've been working remotely from the countryside of Maine for 4 years now. 
    I love the freedom to live where I choose, and have seen the efficiencies that the remote collaboration workflow can bring.</p>
    <h2>Superpower</h2>
    <p>If I could have one and only one super power, it would be the ability to wield stone through telekenesis. Stone is a long term material. It is sturdy and will stand the test of time. I seek to create a lasting postive effect on the world, and I think that's why this super power appeals to me. Which one would you choose?</p>
