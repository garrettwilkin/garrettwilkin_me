### Tell me about a time when you encouraged the adoption of a new tool to a set of users?

When I arrived at the BDN, there were a few things that stood out to me as ready for change.  To put this in
context,
 working  at the BDN would be  my third full time position since graduating with my Computer Science degree.
 Initially I worked a financial software company called Fidessa. This was a highly coordinated organization with
 hundreds of people in a single office building across four floors. Communication quickly gets out of hand with only
 a few close coworkers, but being a team lead with two direct reports and a senior team lead and a manager to report
 to, and your group of 5 people is just one of 6-7 such teams in one area of one department. Of course in the team
 lead role you also coordinate meetings and development with incident response and bug reports. You also maintain a
 staging environment where your team can develop code for a specific client. Of course any code that you write in the
  financial software world is associated with both a ticket and a job that hold code changes (like an issue and pull
  request in GitHub). The ticket includes the technical review from the technical architects team, the original
  requirements from the product manager or support ticket. The job includes a description of the changes, as well as
  a reference back to the ticket. The most important part of this process was the documentation added by the
  developer to the job that implements the technical review that satisfied the requirements from the product manager.
  Part of the job included instructions for the quality assurance (QA) team to use in evaluating whether or not the
  job really did implement the requested change, and also whether or not the change resulted in a failing test case
  in another area of the application (or an unintended consequence in a downstream application).

 The primary reason that I left Fidessa was a lack of opportunity to use open source tools or modern programming
 languages. At the time I was there 2005-2013, we used primarily the Tool Control Language (TCL, pronounced 'tickle')
 . TCL could be a cool language. In some ways, it's incredibly flexible. You can use it to implement many language
 features and design patterns from modern languages. One of our colleagues even went rouge and implemented objects,
 since the version of TCL that we used didn't even support objects. I'm not sure that he'd want to be mentioned by
 name here, but I will say that I really admired his ability. I noticed that fairly routinely, developers who had a
 talent and a manager who was willing to create a little space for their work, would be able to sneak innovations
 like this into the process.

 Another team was able to build an automated install process. This was way before ansible, was in use, but it's quite
  possible that chef cookbooks and puppet were in common use at this time. This was the first automated build system
  that I encountered. The team that built it was able to do it in the scheduling lulls between major releases.


 In both these instances, the teams were successful because they undertook a project that was close to the essential
 business processes of our company.


 I left that job to become the Developer Evangelist at Parse.ly. The BDN had some of the communication styles that
