### Tell me about a time when you encouraged the adoption of a new tool to a set of users?

When I arrived at the BDN, there were a few things that stood out to me as ready for change.  To put this in
context, working  at the BDN would be my third full time position since graduating with my Computer Science degree.
 The bulk of my professional life to this point remains the financial industry of Manhattan. Our conservative company
  culture still allowed for fairly rapid adoption of certain technologies. Particularly in the form of communication.
   Fidessa was right there with the rest of the corporate world at the heigh of the blackberry corporate phone market
    dominance, just prior to the release of the iPhone (iOS) & Android platforms.

Before we had internal instant messenging in the form of some microsoft product whose name I forget, we used yahoo
messenger almost exclusively and unofficially. Once the internal instant messaging app landed, we could have
discussions in regular groups or channels with dozens of participants. Of course this was years before slack.

Then I went to work at Parse.ly, with a fully distributed product team spread across the United States, Canada, and
occassionally Scotland. I was employee number 15, and it was an excellent place to land after spending 8 years with
Fidessa. I picked up a lot of new tools that I had been admiring from afar for a while.

This company actually worked full time in Python. Unfortunately for me, I had been primarily fascinated with node.js
at the time, and this really annoyed the rest of the engineering team. But, before I left I did release my first
Django application code into production. That little bit of code produced a internal monitoring page showing the API
usage level per endpoint, per client.  Diving into Django to build that application caused me to fall in love with it
. I've written three additional django projects since that time.

Parse.ly really excelled at establishing productive communication patterns, and coordinating a remote team. They were
 very results oriented, and seemed to effectively support the growth and productivity of their colleagues.

My job at the BDN was a move back to an office culture. There were a lot of similarities to Fidessa in the dress code
 and communication style, yet the BDN had a distributed workforce across the state of Maine and was actively adopting
  web development technologies.

When I arrived at the BDN they had not yet adopted a group messaging platform. Thankfully, the organization was using
Google apps, and so gmail and hangouts chat was ubiquitous. A few weeks after I joined I was able to introduce slack.
 This was October 2014, and slack had only recently hit the scene. While I was at Parse.ly we used Flowdock, which
 was earlier to market than slack, but must look like a weak competitor to slack at this point in 2017.


But even though Fidessa pays me well, gives me career advancement opportunities, and shows great flexibility toward
my wishes to work from New Jersey and later as one of the first remote employees from Maine, I needed to move on. It
was nice when we got to take a break from writing closed source proprietary tools in TCL and got to write closed
source proprietary tools in Java. But I began to feel like I was missing on on the rapid innovation occuring in the
open source world and in web development in particular.

I guess that I was tired of never being able to show any of my work to anyone. I also did not like the prospects of
working in such an antiquated niche language, TCL. There were attempts by a few rogue developers to introduce python,
 even just for supporting scripts and utilities, but this effort was met with solid resistance. Once, I even produced
  a report describing the benefits I thought Fidessa could realize by developing a REST HTTP/JSON API. But the report
   I delivered went to a manager who didn't have an incentive to consider my suggestion, and didn't have the
   authority to develop something like that which would have been such a departure from what we were doing at the time.


### What was it like to work as part of a financial services software development company?

 Initially I worked a financial software company called Fidessa. This was a highly coordinated organization with
 hundreds of people in a single office building across four floors. Communication quickly gets out of hand with only
 a few close coworkers, but being a team lead with two direct reports and a senior team lead and a manager to report
 to, and your group of 5 people is just one of 6-7 such teams in one area of one department. Of course in the team
 lead role you also coordinate meetings and development with incident response and bug reports. You also maintain a
 staging environment where your team can develop code for a specific client. Of course any code that you write in the
  financial software world is associated with both a ticket and a job that hold code changes (like an issue and pull
  request in GitHub). The ticket includes the technical review from the technical architects team, the original
  requirements from the product manager or support ticket. The job includes a description of the changes, as well as
  a reference back to the ticket. The most important part of this process was the documentation added by the
  developer to the job that implements the technical review that satisfied the requirements from the product manager.
  Part of the job included instructions for the quality assurance (QA) team to use in evaluating whether or not the
  job really did implement the requested change, and also whether or not the change resulted in a failing test case
  in another area of the application (or an unintended consequence in a downstream application).

 The primary reason that I left Fidessa was a lack of opportunity to use open source tools or modern programming
 languages. At the time I was there 2005-2013, we used primarily the Tool Control Language (TCL, pronounced 'tickle')
 . TCL could be a cool language. In some ways, it's incredibly flexible. You can use it to implement many language
 features and design patterns from modern languages. One of our colleagues even went rouge and implemented objects,
 since the version of TCL that we used didn't even support objects. I'm not sure that he'd want to be mentioned by
 name here, but I will say that I really admired his ability. I noticed that fairly routinely, developers who had a
 talent and a manager who was willing to create a little space for their work, would be able to sneak innovations
 like this into the process.

 Another team was able to build an automated install process. This was way before ansible, was in use, but it's quite
  possible that chef cookbooks and puppet were in common use at this time. This was the first automated build system
  that I encountered. The team that built it was able to do it in the scheduling lulls between major releases.


 In both these instances, the teams were successful because they undertook a project that was close to the essential
 business processes of our company.


 I left that job to become the Developer Evangelist at Parse.ly. The BDN had some of the communication styles that
